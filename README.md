Malware Marines Cyber Awareness Course User Guide 

Welcome to the Malware Marines Cyber Awareness Course. To access our project and run our website application, you can use Replit IDE using this link and copying it into your browser: [https://replit.com/@NathanFowler4/MalwareMarinesNew?v=1](https://replit.com/@NathanFowler4/MalwareMarines?v=1). 

This link will require you to ‘fork’ the code and save it to your profile:  

Then you will need to ’run’ the code:  

Then when the program is running, a web view will open on the right-hand side of the screen. We would recommend opening the program in a new tab.  



The code files, our version/commit history as well as this guide can all be found via our GitHub repository link here: https://github.com/ghosthunter6957/CSMT 

Our code can also be run in other IDEs, but we recommend using Replit and the above guide for the best experience.  

 

Log-On 

Test credentials:  

Username 

Password 

Bob 

123 

Admin 

123 

 

Log in functions: There are a few log in profiles however when testing the application only two of those will be useful in understanding how the application works. The first is “Admin” and the password to match that is “123”, this is a user account which has logged on more than once and you can see that by looking at the screen shot above. This is seen through the variable “first” having the value “N” next to it meaning that this is not their first log in. Due to that this will take you to the menu page rather than the welcome page as they have already logged in before. The next account is “bob” whose password is also “123”. This is the same however it's an account who has yet to log into the application. This is seen through the variable “first” having the value “Y” meaning after logging in it will change to “N” however upon logging in for the first time it will take you to the welcome page. After logging in you will need to change “bobs” “first” value back to “Y” in the JSON file to create this first-time logging in affect. 

Main Menu 

Once you've logged on, and started the course, you are presented with our main menu. This page allows the user to traverse to any specified topic we have covered. 

A user can select which ever topic they would like to pick and complete the associated questions. Following completed the questions, after submitting your answers, you will be taken to the next topic in chronological order. For example, after completing the phishing questions, you'll be taken the password topic. After completing insider threats, you'll be taken to the USB section. We would suggest that any new user completes the course in chronological order, starting with social engineering. This ensures the user covers all the content and gets a complete final score.  

If the user is a first-time user, they are taken to the welcome page where the course is explained then following the start course button, the user is taken directly to the first topic, and then can either progress naturally or change topic using the drop down menu.  



Once a user has completed all sections, or follows on from the USB questions, they will be greeted with a congratulations page which displays their score for the whole project.  

 

Drop Down Menu 

This menu can be accessed throughout the course and can be used to traverse to other topics at the discretion of the user. The menu is self-explanatory, the social engineering tab/button will take you to the social engineering material.
